Hello! I am Shivangi, and I identify as a creator: through prose, poetry, art and code as well! This page is meant to be a reflection of who I am as an individual and also to share some of my works with the world. Even though I am not there to greet you in person, dear visitor, but a thousand thanks for dropping by, and hope you have a great time persuing the various posts. :)
